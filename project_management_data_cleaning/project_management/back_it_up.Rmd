# Whoa whoa whoa... just back it up...
I'd recommend backing up your computer approximately once a week. There are a variety of ways to do this:

* Apple Airport

* External Hard Drive

* I just realized this but apparently you can do it with Dropbox Plus which is what I use. Huh.... I think it backs up individual files, though. Not necessarily your hard drive... Which is what my point is.
